# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release.

- `FoPost` client over the FoPost REST API, with `X-API-Key` auth, a 30 second
  per-request timeout, and automatic retries on 429, 5xx and transport errors.
- Resources: `posts`, `workspaces`, `accounts`, `communities`, `labels`,
  `webhooks`, `analytics`, `automations`, `media`.
- Typed models with hand-written `fromJson`, so no build step is needed.
- Typed exceptions per status: validation, authentication, payment required
  (carrying `upgradeUrl`), permission denied, not found, rate limit (carrying
  `retryAfter`) and server errors.
- `FoPost.request` as an escape hatch for endpoints the SDK does not wrap.
- Pure Dart, so it runs on Flutter (iOS, Android, web, desktop) and on the
  server.
